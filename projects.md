I love programming and solving challenging problems. Mainly I work with Python. Recently I have started learning Django and web development.

Inspired by Jennifer Dewalt's [blog](https://jenniferdewalt.com/), I have decided to build one project per week in Django. I will also start writing blog posts about it in future.

Some of my recent projects are:
