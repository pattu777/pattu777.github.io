I love programming and solving challenging problems. Primarily I work with Python. Recently I have started learning Django and web development.

Some of my recent projects are:

* [Lucy](https://github.com/pattu777/Lucy)
* [Realtime Markdown Viewer](https://github.com/pattu777/Markdown-Editor)
* [Blog and URL Shortener](https://github.com/pattu777/LearningDjango/)

I hope to write more posts about technology and algorithms on my blog in future.
