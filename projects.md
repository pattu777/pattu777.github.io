I love programming and solving challenging problems. Primarily I work with Python. Recently I have started learning Django and web development. 

Some of my recent projects are:

* [Task list web app](https://github.com/pattu777/Idea-List)
* [Personal website and blog using Django and bootstrap](https://github.com/pattu777/MySite)

I have also started solving algorithmic problems. I hope to write more about it on my blog.
