I love programming and solving challenging problems. Primarily I work with Python. Recently I have started learning Django and web development.

Some of my recent projects are:

* [Lucy](https://github.com/pattu777/Lucy) - A CLI tool to generate software licenses.
* [Markdown Editor](https://github.com/pattu777/Markdown-Editor) - A real time Markdown viewer that I built while learning Node.js.
* [Blog and URL Shortener](https://github.com/pattu777/LearningDjango/) - Apps that I built while learning Django.
* [Ansible-Playground](https://github.com/pattu777/Ansible-Playground) - A set of playbooks to automate server setup.
