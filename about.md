My name is Chinmaya Kr. Patanaik. I am a master's student in computer science at Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic. I was born and raised in a small town called Berhampur in the south-eastern part of India but moved to Prague in 2014.

Recently I worked as a software engineering intern in the ExpenseIt team at Concur Technologies. Previously I also worked as a software engineer for a cloud management startup, "Xervmon" in Bangalore, India. You can find my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwFCuugUZy8hRkdKRVI4ZzB6ekU/view?usp=sharing).
