My name is Chinmaya Kr. Patanaik. I am a master's student in computer science at Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic. I was born and raised in a small town called Berhampur in the south-eastern part of India but moved to Prague in October, 2014.

Recently I joined the ExpenseIt team at Concur Technologies as a software engineering intern. Previously I also worked as a software engineer for a cloud management startup, "Xervmon" in Bangalore, India. I hope to write new posts related to technology in future. Check out my blog for more information.
