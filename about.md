I am a master's student in computer science at Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic. I was born and raised in a small town called Berhampur in the south-eastern part of India but moved to Prague in October, 2014.

Besides my studies, I work as a software engineering intern in the ExpenseIt team at Concur Technologies. Previously I also worked as a software engineer for a cloud management startup, "Xervmon" in Bangalore, India. I hope to write new posts related to technology in future. Check out my blog for more information.
