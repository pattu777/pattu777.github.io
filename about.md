I am a software engineer. Currently I'm part of the Live team at [Browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com/). My day to day work involves Ruby on Rails and Node.js. Before my current role, I also worked as a backend engineer at [Haptik](https://haptik.ai). I was responsible for building and scaling cricket scores, reminders and daily fun channel at Haptik. Apart from that I also built various chatbots(April fool, Mother's Day etc) to drive product growth.

I did my Bachelors in Computer Science from NIT, Silchar. Later I was enrolled in the Master's program(Discontd.) in computer science at Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic. During my Master's, I also worked as a software engineering intern in the ExpenseIt team at Concur Technologies.

Prior to that, I also worked as a software engineer for a cloud management startup, "Xervmon" in Bangalore, India. You can find my resume from the sidebar.
